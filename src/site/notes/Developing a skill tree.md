How different is a skill tree to a [curriculum]?
I want to develop a skill tree for my instrument playing (for me and for teaching)

I can apply a skill tree to other areas in life
Break down goal/targets or push limits of current skills.

A skill tree may work similar to how an [[Impossible List\|Impossible List]] works. Sometimes you will have targets that you know how to break down. Other times, an unexpected development may happen that takes the branch somewhere I didn't know it could.

What are the skills I currently have? What are the target skills?
How do I avoid getting stuck in goals and incorporate [Systems]/[Habits]?
- Each skill may have it's own system written in a note for it. Maybe the system/habit is the process of moving through the skill tree.
- The skills may be milestones or newly established habits.
