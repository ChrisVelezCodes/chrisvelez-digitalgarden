Nodes will be used for mayor areas, specific goals and milestones (heirarchy or nah?)

Habit systems may be described within area notes or milestone notes?

The issue: 
- I have many interests and my attention them changes every other month. 
- Each area have a variety of sub-interests within it.
- Often, I'm attempting to reach a goal or milestone, or develop and practice an ongoing system.
- I often fall off one interest and move on to the other one.
- Can documenting my journey through various interest aid in reaching desired milestones and in returning to where I left of when I fall off?
- Can I develop an interest well enough to contribute to my overall well-being (physical, social, financial, emotional, spiritual, etc)?

An [[Impossible List\|Impossible List]] has been helpful in shamelessly detailing great things I want to accomplish. 
- It is flexible in that milestones may be unknown at the beginning. But a specific goal is usually in place.
- There's a focusing on reaching the next level. I wonder how well it works with building up to a goal by itself.


A [[Developing a skill tree\|skill tree]] can be a great way to visualize connections between milestones. Particularly in the form or pre-requisites, like in a curriculum. 
- I can delineate a path towards a particular goal or skill.
- Paths may have shortcuts (buying a piece of equipment instead of building it, completing a separate but more difficult goal)

Using [linked notes] and possibly a canvas feature in Obsidian can be a way to have notes interconnected in a skill tree format. Notes would have all the information gathered and created related to the goal/skill

A canvas may be a barrier because it takes time to visually arrange things... at the same time, it may help when you want a static visual of the skill tree
