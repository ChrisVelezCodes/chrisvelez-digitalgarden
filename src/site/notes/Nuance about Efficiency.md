Efficiency is about input and output
Doing more with less.
It seeks to avoid waste, or figure out what waste is. (something can appear wasteful, but not be actually wasteful)
Seems simple, but often isn't.

# What is efficiency?
## Where it came from?
In the US, Frederick Winslow Taylor
[[Scientific Management System (Frederick W Taylor)\|Scientific Management System (Frederick W Taylor)]] or Taylorism
"not waste seconds gazing out the window"

## Today
Hustle culture, grind
calendar apps, doordash, slack/emails
finding ways to monetize hobbies during covid
Shortform documentaries, or short, summarized versions of books
Tiktok
[[To monetize or not to monetize\|To monetize or not to monetize]]
[[Consuming short form vs long form content\|Consuming short form vs long form content]]

Demand for efficiency in public schools

# The Waste Problem
Makes a lot of sense in chemistry: specific goals
Less sense in community: there isn't one best way, there are other factors
[[What is waste? Is X a waste of X?\|What is waste? Is X a waste of X?]]

Now a days our work decides what is the best way, and what is wasteful. 
Behaviors that are **seen** as wasteful. (often based on marginalization. 
- masculine vs femi nine passtimes
- neurotypical beh as respectful vs neurodivergent beh as lazy
- logic vs emotion
- work vs leisure

Daily life activities **seen** as wasteful (you know the typical home things we do that we want only women to do, and such), ignoring creativity and innovation

Ex of the doodling student; a behavior that **looks** wasteful

"Is this a waste? who is this for?"
"writing a shitty paragraph stopped me from writing the good ones"
Reminds me of the funny video of the guy saying that coming to X place that you didn't want to be in wasn't a waste, because if you had not come to X place, then you wouldn't know that you don't want to be in X place.

Utilitarian view on art (video essays' lenght)

>Just because something is concise, doesn't mean it's good.

There IS such thing as waste.
But:
>Efficiency often looks like inefficiency.

The next question is: Do we know if this Thing worth doing? 

# The Effectiveness Problem
You can only be effective in relation to a goal
[[The Cobra effect\|The Cobra effect]]

- snake problem
	- "Kill snakes! bring us snake skins and will give you a reward"
	- People started breeding snakes to bring in more snake skins, making the problem worse
- The incentive was effective at increasing the number of snake skins brought in, but NOT effective at reducing the amount of snakes.
	- the effectiveness depends on the goal

>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

The measure becomes the focus, not the actual goal you had initially.

Disconnect between the [[Measure of Effectiveness\|Measure of Effectiveness]] and the [[Measure of Performance\|Measure of Performance]]

In a situation where there's:
- A desired effect to be achieved (this is the [[Measure of Effectiveness\|Measure of Effectiveness]], the number of dead snakes)
- A need to measure the degree to which that effect is being achieved
- And a direct measure of the desired effect is difficult or impossible
The analyst identifies:
- some other measure that is not difficult or impossible to measure
	- whose value correlates in some known way to the achievement of desired effect.
Then the analyst is:
- stuck measuring this proxy (This is proxy is the [[Measure of Performance\|Measure of Performance]], the number of snake skins )

School system examples
_Team Human_ quote about how we start thinking of humans in terms of our latest technologies; currently digital media. Mechanomorphism. Thinking of brains as machines that can and must be "optimized". 

Tools may helps us do our job efficiently, but are the side effects worth it?

Quote from _The Shallows: What the Internet is Doing to Our Minds_, with a similar point, treating the brain as an outdated computer

# Where do we go from here?
How do we value the parts of us that are fundamentally human?

Efficiency as a cultural thing has been around only for about 100 years

Efficiency appears to be so intuitive and obvious
