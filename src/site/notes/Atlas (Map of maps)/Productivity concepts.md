>> A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over, beginning with a working simple system.

"Personal" could be interchanged with a subsection your knowledge, in order to apply this to that area (or simply to understand this idea better)
>[!example]
>Bible Knowledge Management
>Music Therapy Knowledge Management
>These are basically just another way of talking about MOCs or Hubs

## The goal is ultimately to create, communicate, and express
The E in Tiago Forte's CODE (Capture, Organize, Distill, Express)
